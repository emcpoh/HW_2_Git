## HW_2_Git

In this homework i learned to use new (for me) Git commands, like:
1.  `git chekout`
2.  `git branch`
3.  `git merge`

Also, it gave me a better understanding of working with Git and allowed me to understand the principles of working with branches in Git.
All tasks and results of my work you can find in this [file](https://github.com/emcpoh/HW_2_Git/blob/main/HW_2_Git.txt).
